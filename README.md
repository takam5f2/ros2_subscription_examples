# ros2_subscription_examples

Example programs for demonstrating data read from subscription of ROS 2.

## packages

These example programs consist of four pakages.

- [simple_examples](./simple_examples)
- [intra_process_talker_listener](./intra_process_talker_listener)
- [intra_process_examples](./intra_process_examples)
- [waitset_examples](./waitset_examples)

These are based on taker-listener in [GitHub - ros2/demos at humble](https://github.com/ros2/demos/tree/humble). If you know the talker-listener well, you can also understand these sample codes. Only `intra_process_examples` is based on [demos/intra_process_demo/src/two_node_pipeline/two_node_pipeline.cpp at humble · ros2/demos](https://github.com/ros2/demos/blob/humble/intra_process_demo/src/two_node_pipeline/two_node_pipeline.cpp) exceptionally.

## how-to build

```console
mkdir ros2_subscription_test
cd ros2_subscription_test
git clone git@github.com:takam5f2/ros2_subscription_examples.git
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
source install/setup.bash
```

## how-to run

### `simple_examples`

You need two terminals one of which is for talker and another for listener.

#### run talker

Execute command below to run talker node on a terminal.

```console
ros2 run simple_examples [talker node]
```

The talker supports some additional options unlike the talker of [GitHub - ros2/demos at humble](https://github.com/ros2/demos/tree/humble). For example, you can change frequency of messages transmission by `update_frequency` option as below.

```console
ros2 run simple_examples talker --ros-args -p update_frequency:=2.0
```

If you want to use multiple options, you can add subsequent options as `-p option_args:=<value>`.

#### talker nodes list

Below is the list of talker nodes included in simple_examples package.

- `talker`
  - behavior
    - it outputs a `/chatter` topic message per specified frequency
  - option
    - `update_frequency` (float)
      - specify output frequency of messages
      - default is 1.0
    - `use_transient_local` (boolean)
      - enable Transient Local of Publisher
      - default is false
- `serialized_message_talker`
  - behavior
    - output `/chatter` of SerializedMessage type per one second
  - no option

#### run listener

Execute command below to run listener node on another terminal.

```console
ros2 run simple_examples [listener node]
```

The listener of [ros2_subscription_examples/simple_examples at main · takam5f2/ros2_subscription_examples](https://github.com/takam5f2/ros2_subscription_examples/tree/main/simple_examples) is driven by timer unlike the listener of [GitHub - ros2/demos at humble](https://github.com/ros2/demos/tree/humble) which is driven by subscription of `/chatter` topic message.

#### listener nodes list

Below is the list of listener nodes included in simple_examples package.

### `intra_process_talker_listener`

There are a few sample programs in `intra_process_talker_listener` in which a topic message is obtained by `take_data()` method and then processed by a callback function through `execute()` method. Intra-process communication requires a pair of publisher and subscription is located on a same Linux process. Then a pair of listener and talker must be launched as composable nodes. The package provides two sample launch files to start listener and talker on a composable nodes.

#### run by launcher

Execute command below to run `talker_listener_intra_process.launch.py`.

```console
ros2 launch intra_process_talker_listener talker_listener_intra_process.launch.py
```

The launch file supports some options. Below is an example to use `use_intra_process_comms` option.

```console
ros2 launch intra_process_talker_listener talker_listener_intra_process.launch.py use_intra_process_comms:=false
```

If `use_intra_process_comms` is set to `false`, communication between nodes is performed through DDS. If it is set to `true`, communication is performed through intra-process communication.

#### launch files list

Below is the list of launch files included in intra_process_talker_listener package.

- talker_listener_intra_process.launch.py
  - behavior
    - It launches `talker_intra_process` and `timer_listener_intra_process`
    - `talker_intra_process` transmits `/chatter` message and `timer_listener_intra_process` receives it
    - if `use_intra_process_comms` is set to `true`, intra-process communication is performed between the two nodes
    - if `use_intra_process_comms` is set to `false`, a communication through DDS is performed between the two nodes
  - option
    - `use_intra_process_comms` (boolean)
      - enable intra-process communication
      - default is true
    - `talker_update_frequency` (float)
      - specify frequency of publishing `/chatter` message by `talker_intra_process`
      - default is 1.0
    - `listener_update_frequency` (float)
      - specify timer frequency of `timer_listener_intra_process`
      - default is 1.0
    - `use_transient_local` (boolean)
      - enable Transient Local of Publisher and Subscription
      - default is false
- talker_batch_listener_intra_process.launch.py
  - behavior
    - It launches `talker_intra_process` and `timer_batch_listener_intra_process`
    - `talker_intra_process` transmits `/chatter` message and `timer_batch_listener_intra_process` receives it
    - `timer_batch_listener_intra_process` executes a callback function per five seconds in which topic messages are obtained from Subscription Queue until the queue becomes empty
  - option
    - `use_intra_process_comms` (boolean)
      - enable intra-process communication
      - default is true

### `intra_process_example`

As well as using composable nodes, intra-process communication also can be used between nodes on MultiThreadedExecutor to which they are registered, which you can see in `intra_process_example`.
`/consumer` and `/producer` nodes run in `intra_process_example` and `/producer` publishes a topic message and `/consumer` obtains it.

#### run

Execute `two_node_pipeline_timer` with the following command.

```console
 ros2 run intra_process_examples two_node_pipeline_timer
```

It has no particular option. A cyclic timer invokes the corresponding callback function. Another callback function, which is corresponding to the subscription, is called from the timer based callback function if a incoming message arrives. `two_node_pipeline_timer` shows two thread ID (TID); one is printed out from the timer based callback function and the other is from the subscription based one. They should be same number because their callback function should be executed on a same thread.

### `waitset_examples`

You need two terminals; one is for talker and the other for listener.

#### run talker

Launch a terminal and execute talker node with the following command.

```console
ros2 run waitset_examples talker_triple
```

#### talker node list

Only `talker_triple` is provided as talker node in the `waitset_examples` package.

- `talker_triple`

  - behavior

    - It transmits three kinds of topic messages; `/chatter`, `/slower_chatter` and `/slowest_chatter`. They have different transmission frequency.
    - `/slower_chatter` and `/slowest_chatter` are not transmitted if there is no corresponding subscription
    - `/chatter` is transmitted at frequency defined by `update_frequency`
    - `/slower_chatter` is transmitted at one half of frequency defined by `update_frequency`
    - `/slowest_chatter` is transmitted at one third of frequency defined by `update_frequency`
